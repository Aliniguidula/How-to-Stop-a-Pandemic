 **********************************************************************/
This assignment had several tough spots. The graph weight conversions messed up
Dijkstra's algorithm at first because I forgot to divide by 100 when restoring weights.
Testing disconnected graphs revealed bugs in my pathfinding. The worst part was the
immunization strategies (rNumberCC/generationsDegree). Drawing the graphs helped visualize
problems.

 **********************************************************************/
I gained deep hands-on experience with graph algorithms and Java implementation details.
While frustrating at times, I enjoyed seeing theoretical concepts materialize in code.
The style checker initially felt picky, but now I appreciate how it enforces
professional coding standards.
